This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript.
The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful web services implemented with Node.js.
The course also has parts on TypeScript, Redux, and React Native.

Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.

### Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have:

- good programming skills
- basic knowledge of web programming and databases and
- know the basics of the Git version control system.
  
You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.

Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required.

### Course material

The course material is meant to be read one part at a time and in order.

The material contains exercises, which are placed so that the preceding material provides enough information for solving each exercise.
You can do the exercises as you encounter them in the material,
but it can also be beneficial to read all of the material in the part before starting with the exercises.

In many parts of the course, the exercises build one larger application one small piece at a time.
Some of the exercise applications are developed through multiple parts.

The course material is based on incrementally expanding example applications, which change from part to part.
It's best to follow the code along while making small modifications independently.
The code of the example applications for each step of each part can be found on GitHub.

### Taking the course

The course contains 10 parts, the first of which is numbered 0 for consistency with past iterations.
One part corresponds loosely to one week (averaging 15-20 hours) of studying,
but this varies as has been taken into account with respect to coursework.

For parts 0-5, Proceeding from part *n* to part *n+1* is not sensible before enough know-how of the topics in part *n*  has been achieved.
In pedagogic terms, the course uses [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning).
You should only proceed to the next part after doing enough of the previous part's exercises.

In parts 1-4 you are expected to do *at least* all of the exercises that are not marked with an asterisk(*).
Exercises marked with an asterisk count towards your final grade, but skipping them does not prevent you from doing the compulsory exercises in the next parts.
Other parts do not have asterisk-marked exercises since there is no similar dependency on previous parts.

You will need to complete the course and the course parts as specified on Canvas and based on those due dates, as some of the course parts are optional.

### Course channel in Discord

You can discuss the course and related topics in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VRUKRxCJ95).
Discord will have different channels for both your learning partners as well as course-related conversations.
You will be expected to be active on Discord!

### Parts and completion

The COMP 227 course consists of the core course and multiple extensions.

#### Parts 0-5 (core course) - Full Stack Web Development

Part of your grade for the course will be based on the total number of submitted exercises for parts 0-5 (including exercises marked with an asterisk).

**Do not assume this is where your grade will come from**.

We will be having other exercises and assignments as well that will be just as important to your grade.

A rough calculation for this portion is as follows:

| exercises    | rough grade for exercise portion    |
| ------------ | :------: |
| 138          | A        |
| 127          | B+        |
| 116          | B        |
| 105          | C        |
| 94           | C-       |
| 83           | D        |
| 72           | F        |

If you wish to pass the course, you will need to submit the assignments as listed in Canvas.
You must also complete the course exam.
The exam does not count towards your final grade, but you must pass it.
More info about the exam will be discussed via canvas and discord.

You can only take the exam after submitting a sufficient number of exercises.
It is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises.
The exam is the same and does not count toward your grade (you just need to pass it).

For the other modules, we will determine at a later date which ones will be completed, but these may be done in a different order sequence.

| Additional Modules | Module name | Minimum Exercises to submit | work needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6  | Redux | 24 | 1 |
| 7  | React router, hooks & styling | 24 | 1 |
| 8  | TypeScript | 24 | 1 |
| 9 | React Native | 10 | 1 |

### Studying the course in a nutshell

How to study the course â€“ instructions in a nutshell:

- Do the exercises. The exercises are submitted through GitHub and marking them as done on Canvas.
- You need to work regularly.
  The easiest way to fall behind in the course is to not work on it every couple of days.
  Set yourself an alarm...do anything! But make it a habit of working on it at least 3 times a week for a little bit of time.

### Submitting exercises

You will be submitting exercises via the GitHub classroom repos that will be provided on Canvas.
**All of the exercises from this website must be submitted through GitHub.**
You will also be expected to submit your progress for exercises regularly, even if it is not finished.

Exercises are submitted **one part at a time**.
Once you have submitted exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any more exercises for that part.

A system for detecting plagiarism is used to check exercises submitted to GitHub.
If code is found from model answers or multiple students hand in the same code,
the situation is handled according to the policy on plagiarism as outlined in the syllabus.

Many of the exercises build a larger application bit by bit.
You will be expected to commit often so that you show your work as you move through the course.
You will need to practice committing early and often.
It is the equivalent of showing your work in class.

### Full stack project

For the project, an application is implemented in React and/or Node, though implementing a mobile application in React Native is also possible.

You will be expected to work on the project either as a pair or as a group.

More information about the project will be released via Canvas

### Before you start

Using a Chromium-based browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended while developing because 
it provides great tools for web development.
I will be showing you and providing screenshots of those tools.
Another alternative is the [Developer Edition of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/),
which provides a similar range of features.

In [part 0c](/part0/configuring_your_machine_for_this_course) we'll provide detailed instructions for installing some of the tools that we will be using extensively:
[Git](https://git-scm.org) (via GitHub),
[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The course exercises will be submitted to GitHub, so Git must be installed and you should know how to use it.

### Typos in the material

If you find a typo in the material, or something has been expressed unclearly or is simply bad grammar,
submit a *pull request* to the course material in the [repository](https://github.com/comp227/comp227).
For example, the markdown source code of this page can be found in the repository at <https://github.com/comp227/comp227/edit/source/src/content/0/en/part0a.md>

At the bottom of each part of the material is a link to **propose changes to the material**.
You can edit the source code of the page by clicking on the link.

There are also lots of links in the material for many kinds of background material.
If you notice that a link is broken (that happens too often...),
propose a change or ping us in Discord if you do not find a replacement for the broken link.
